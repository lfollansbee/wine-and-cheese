# Cheesy Wine Pairings

Deployed URL: https://cheesy-wine-pairs.firebaseapp.com/

###Quarter 1 project for Galvanize Platte, May, 2016.
Created a single page app where a user can input a type of wine and receive a cheese pairing recommendation. This was my first quarter project for Galvanize.

Technologies used include AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, and HTML.
Also, I created and deployed my own API to query for images and pairings.
