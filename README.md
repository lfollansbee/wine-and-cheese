# Cheesy Wine Pairings
###Quarter 1 project for Galvanize Platte, 2016.
Created a single page app where a user can input a type of wine and receive a cheese pairing recommendation. This was my first quarter project for Galvanize.

Technologies used include AJAX, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, and HTML. 
Also used an API to query for images and pairings.
